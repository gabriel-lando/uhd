/*!
 * Overlap-aware wideband reconstruction for two bonded radios.
 *
 * Two radios each capture a wider slice of a target channel with an
 * intentional spectral overlap (instead of a hard split):
 *
 *   target: a channel of width target_bw centered at fc
 *   radio1: tuned at fc + radio1_offset_hz, captures per_radio_bw
 *   radio2: tuned at fc + radio2_offset_hz, captures per_radio_bw
 *
 * The shared overlap (width overlap_bw, centered on fc) is used to align the
 * two radios (relative gain, phase and fractional delay) and to crossfade the
 * two complex spectra.  The out-of-band corners are discarded.  The result is a
 * single contiguous complex baseband at target_rate.
 *
 * Pipeline (all complex / phase preserving — suitable for decoding):
 *   1. rational-resample each radio per_radio_rate -> target_rate
 *   2. per FFT frame: translate each radio to the target baseband by an integer
 *      bin shift, estimate/apply the radio2->radio1 alignment over the overlap,
 *      crossfade the overlap, discard corners, IFFT (overlap-save).
 *
 * The class is pure C++ (self-contained FFT, no GNU Radio / FFTW dependency) so
 * it can be unit-tested under ctest and wrapped by a GNU Radio block.
